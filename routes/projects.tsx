            While I already had decent experience with React from previous

            Considering that, instead of creating a new repository for every
            required project, I've just adapted everything to be used here,
            inside Deno, Fresh and Preact.

            That way, not only I practice what I need to, but I'm also forcing
            myself to go the extra mile and solve problems that this
            unintended/unsuported setup will cause me to have. Plus, I can get
            to make them look like the way I like them, rather than using the
            default course styling.

            Every project page includes a toggleable summary of what I learned
            when completing the project. Overall, I don't think it was that
            useful for me because I had already learned the large bulk of React
            features previously by building websites for my freelance clients.
            While it was nice to learn about Fragments, React.createElement(),
            Portals and Context, almost none of my clients jobs would benefit by
            any of those, so it was mostly nice-to-know course for me.
