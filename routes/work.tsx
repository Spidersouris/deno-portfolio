            it to be, as I didn't like having to rely on another website's data.

            After freelancing for design agencies for a while, in 2022 I decided
            to eventually move out of freelancing and try to get a remote job in
            a tech company. Using Wix/SquareSpace/Framer templates to build
            websites was really wearing me off, since we were just building
            contract websites as fast as possible only to start the next. Just
            felt like the lack of testing, UX and post-launch care for the
            product wasn't like how WebDev was meant to be.

            Since I wasn't having much luck getting professionally into tech, in

            backend, which is currently written with Node.JS and Express, but I
            want to eventually rewrite it with Deno and Oak instead. Currently
