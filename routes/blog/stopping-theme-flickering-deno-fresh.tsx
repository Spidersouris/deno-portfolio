            , we built a simple Theme Switcher using Preact and Fresh on top of
            Deno. Two things were missing in that implementation we are going to

            is a very interesting design pattern. You serve static HTML content
            (the "ocean") to the client's browser and only hydrate a little of
            Javascript (the "island") in specific portions of the User
            Interface, upon user request. By default, this approach will never
            ship any Javascript to the client, essentially creating zero
            overhead on served pages, which leads to more performant pages with
            higher Lighthouse scores.

            So by now, you might have realized that not shipping Javascript by
            default has its drawbacks. If the page first needs to load before it
            can download the Javascript to change the theme colors, then we
            can't have our theme applied from the get-go, with no choice but to
            have our clients have to put up with the flickering, right? Well,
            not exactly...
          </p>
          {/* Main content start */}
          <StyledSubHeader title="Opting out of the Islands Architecture" />
          <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            It's possible that we can ship the required Javascript on every
            page, but in doing so, you need to understand the tradeoffs:
          </p>
          <GreekList

              "You introduce consistent overhead to every page load, which will progressively worsen your Lighthouse page performance score, the more you do it.",
              "You are deviating from the main design choice for the framework, which means that you will not find a lot of resources to do things this way from this point onwards. If you have questions, you will have to mostly figure something out by yourself.",
            ]}
          />
          At this point, I have to ask you: Is this feature essential for your
          project? Is the design of your website impossible to be done in a
          happy medium between Light and Dark modes? If the answer to both of
          these questions is "yes", we can now start looking into how to break
          the rules.

            So there you have it, a Theme Switcher that sets the correct theme,
            acknowledges the user's preferences, and doesn't flicker on the
            initial load.

            What other ways could you possibly implement a Theme Switcher

          <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            One of the options would be to use route-based theming. You could
            create your entire website nested in either a{" "}
            <code class="shl-inline">
              /light
            </code>{" "}
            or{" "}

              /dark
            </code>{" "}
            route (or better yet, a single{" "}
            <code class="shl-inline">
              /[theme]
            </code>{" "}
            route!), and have your index redirect to either of those based on
            their OS color-scheme preference. The drawback to this approach is
            that you can't give the users a pretty theme transition when they
            switch themes, since that will force an entire page reload when they
            get redirected, but regardless, it's still a possibility that you
            could implement.

          {/* App router, but maybe just use NextJS instead? */}
          <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            Another option would be to not save the theme to{" "}

              localStorage
            </code>{" "}
            and also never redirect, essentially turning your application into a

            reset on every visit, which would be annoying if people had to come
            back to your website regularly. If you are just creating a portfolio
            website that is meant for recruiters to check once and dip, that is
            not a big deal, but for a blogging website (like this one!), it's
            pretty much unacceptable. This option also isn't really what Fresh
            is going for either, so at this point you might as well just use
