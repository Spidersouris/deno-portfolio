            For some good portion of the most last decade, I was using the

            Trophy hunting, while fun, often times can feel like another job.
            You often feel like you have to track so many moving parts at once
            to make sure you don't miss anything and you stay efficient,
            otherwise you either never complete your backlog, or tank your
            average completion or end up adding some unobtainable trophies to
            your account.

            assume you are going through extreme survival scenarios and more

            In late 2017, I felt like trophy hunting would be greatly improved
            if we could get a way to link and display our trophies on Discord,
            but no bots out there offered this kind of data.
          </p>
          <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            After not really getting anywhere with it, in March 2018 I decided
            that if no one was willing to create a Discord bot for trophy
            hunting, then I was going to need to{" "}

            Yura.

            I've kept maintainining and adding new features to Yura for several
            years, before it ultimately collapsed when its data source killed
            all external access by implementing a stronger DDoS protection
            through Cloudflare.

            Myself and a few other members had been asking for several new

            ears. It couldn't go on like that anymore, something had to be done
            about it.
