            For some good portion of the most last decade, I was using the
            majority of my free time earning some of the hardest trophies out
            there on PSN, never shying away from the next hard game to complete.

            Trophy hunting, while fun, often times can feel like another job.
            You often feel like you have to track so many moving parts at once
            to make sure you don't miss anything and you stay efficient,
            otherwise you either never complete your backlog, or tank your
            average completion or end up adding some unobtainable trophies to
            your account.

            I track my physical/body progress every week on Instagram and it has
            been inspiring for some of my peers to watch my progress, but I
            honestly have no desire of becoming a celebrity. It's so easy to
            waste so much good useful time on social media and I feel far more

            I've had people asking me what is my secret for changing so much and
            the truth is that there is no secret. If you just eat properly,
            sleep enough, and push your limit as often as possible (with proper
            form), you will grow bigger. Your muscles simply don't know that
            they are being forced so hard because you are a masochist, they just
            assume you are going through extreme survival scenarios and more
            muscle is needed for increased odds at your survival. It's just that

            In late 2017, I felt like trophy hunting would be greatly improved
            if we could get a way to link and display our trophies on Discord,
            but no bots out there offered this kind of data.
          </p>
          <p class="space">
            After not really getting anywhere with it, in March 2018 I decided
            that if no one was willing to create a Discord bot for trophy
            hunting, then I was going to need to{" "}

              title="Just like Thanos"
              customRel="noopener noreferrer"
            />. And so I did, I learned how to write Javascript and started
            Yura.

          <p class="space">
            I've kept maintainining and adding new features to Yura for several
            years, before it ultimately collapsed when its data source killed
            all external access by implementing a stronger DDoS protection
            through Cloudflare.

          <p class="space">
            Myself and a few other members had been asking for several new
            features for years, but ultimately all of our feedback fell in deaf
            ears. It couldn't go on like that anymore, something had to be done
            about it.
