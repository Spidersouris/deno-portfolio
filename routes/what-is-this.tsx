            is a very common word in the world of Javascript if you are used to
            Object-Oriented Programming or old-school front-end development. In
            the first case, it refers to the Instance of a class that is
            currently being used. The second, it's about the{" "}

            refers to this website and this page will be used to talk about the
            tech stack used to create it. This is quite a bit technical and if

            Deno is a secure Javascript/Typescript runtime, forcing developers
            to opt-in when using any potentially harmful behavior (like making
            network connections or reading/writing to the disk). The reason I
            chose to use Deno, however, is for enabling me able to write
            Typescript code without needing to transpile it back to Javascript
            before deployment. For reference,{" "}

            also allows developers to run Typescript natively since that also
            has built-in support for Typescript right out-of-the-box.

            Fresh is the default Full-Stack framework for building Web Apps with
            Deno. It uses File System Routing, no builds (really, none!),
            out-of-the-box Typescript support (are you seeing a pattern here?),
            zero-configuration, and ships static HTML pages to the client with 0

          <p class="text-justify">
            Preact is the UI library of choice for Fresh since it can be
            JIT-compiled with 0 build-time. It's also Typescript compatible
            (another one!) and can do nearly anything that normal React could.

          <p class="text-justify">
            Twind is a tailwind-in-js solution, it does everything that Tailwind
            can do, using the same syntax. It also requires no
            building/bundling, hence why it's the tech of choice for Fresh apps.
            It also serves as a drop-in replacement for its original library,
            just like Preact+React. While it does help me with the initial
            styling, I still end up writing CSS classes instead of relying on
            Twind and spamming inline styles.
