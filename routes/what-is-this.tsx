            is a very common word in the world of Javascript if you are used to
            Object-Oriented Programming or old-school front-end development. In
            the first case, it refers to the Instance of a class that is
            currently being used. The second, it's about the{" "}
            <span class="shl-inline">window</span> or{" "}
            <span class="shl-inline">document</span> objects.

            refers to this website and this page will be used to talk about the
            tech stack used to create it. This is quite a bit technical and if
            you are not a developer, it's okay if it goes over your head.

            Deno is a secure Javascript/Typescript runtime, forcing developers
            to opt-in when using any potentially harmful behavior (like making
            network connections or reading/writing to the disk). The reason I
            chose to use Deno, however, is for enabling me able to write
            Typescript code without needing to transpile it back to Javascript
            before deployment. For reference,{" "}

            also allows developers to run Typescript natively since that also
            has built-in support for Typescript right out-of-the-box.

            Fresh is the default Full-Stack framework for building Web Apps with

            out-of-the-box Typescript support (are you seeing a pattern here?),
            zero-configuration, and ships static HTML pages to the client with 0

            Preact is the UI library of choice for Fresh since it can be

            Twind v0 is a tailwind-in-js solution, it claims to do everything
            that Tailwind can do, using the same syntax (but essentially has a
            ton of bugs, which v1 addresses). It also requires no
            building/bundling step, hence why it's the tech of choice for Fresh
            apps. v0 claims to serve as a drop-in replacement for its original
            library, just like Preact+React, but lacks many of the features that
            real tailwind has. I initially used twind to get my foot on the door
            with styling, but wrote real CSS instead. This approach ended up
            being bad because I was having to micromanage which files get sent
            to each route which is some really boring process, so I've defined
            my custom classes as twind v0 plugins and allow it to handle
            shipping the correct CSS to specific pages for me instead.
