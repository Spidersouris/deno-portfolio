              Sadly I didn't learn anything practical from doing this project,
              as all that was taught were things I've already known about from
              building stuff before.
            </p>

            {/* // second paragraph */}
            <p class="my-2 text-justify">
              I learned some theorical things which might be useful when dealing
              with legacy codebases, like how React (the course's focus) can
              render components by nesting React.createElement(component,
              properties, child1, child2, child3, ..., childN) and this is the
              way that it was done before JSX.
            </p>

            {/* // third paragraph */}
            <p class="my-2 text-justify">
              It makes sense why everything is a component, otherwise it would
              get really easy to enter a component hell with that style. JSX
              isn't much different, but written as HTML instead of nesting
              functions.
            </p>

            {/* // fourth paragraph */}
            <p class="my-2 text-justify">
              I felt like this specific project didn't go deep enough. It didn't
              make me 'CRUD' the expenses, which I just ended up having to
              figure out and do by myself (that was the fun part!). I also went
              the extra mile with a few things, deviating from the project
              structure and styling to challenge myself a bit more.
