It features no build-time, zero config, typescript support out-of-the-box, JIT-rendering and uses the Island design architecture (more about this in a minute). The premise here is very simple: Single Page Applications rely really heavily on the Client's devices to build the webpages and that will impact your performance. Fresh, just like Remix (and to some extent Next), aims to move all the rendering back to the server and serves exclusively static HTML pages, hydrating any potential Javascript interactivity only when absolutely necessary. While that's amazing for Lighthouse performance, it comes with its own sets of drawbacks.",
